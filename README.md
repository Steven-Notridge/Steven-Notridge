I'm Steven, with years of technical cloud experience behind me, and I'm doing everything I can to enter the DevOps world as I've developed my own undying love for Linux and coding in general. It all started with a simple PowerShell script a few years ago, and sitting next to a DevOps engineer. I always felt support roles have been somewhat tedious and don't require much thought, but DevOps is constantly evolving and on the go. Since then, I've been slowly building up some skills, but now I'm going full steam ahead.
